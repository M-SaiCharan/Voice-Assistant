This project implements a simple voice assistant in Python. The assistant can provide weather updates, read news headlines, and set reminders based on voice commands.

## Features
1. **Weather Updates**:
   - Get real-time weather information for a specified city using the WeatherAPI.

2. **News Headlines**:
   - Fetch and read out the top three news headlines from NewsAPI.

3. **Reminders**:
   - Set a reminder with a specific time and message.

4. **Voice Interaction**:
   - Uses speech recognition and text-to-speech to interact with the user.

## Prerequisites
1. **Python**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed on your system.

2. **API Keys**:
   - **WeatherAPI**: Sign up at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to obtain an API key.
   - **NewsAPI**: Sign up at [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to obtain an API key.
  
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local system using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M-SaiCharan/Voice-Assistant.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:
   Use the following command to install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run
1. Replace the placeholders for API keys in the `get_weather` and `get_news` functions in main.py with your actual keys.
2. Run the script using Python:
   
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
3. The assistant will start listening for your commands.

## Commands
1. **Weather**:
   - Say "weather" to fetch weather details.
   - The assistant will prompt you to specify a city.

2. **News**:
   - Say "news" to hear the top news headlines.

3. **Reminder**:
   - Say "reminder" to set a reminder.
   - Provide the time in HH:MM format and a message.

4. **Exit**:
   - Say "stop" or "exit" to close the assistant.

## Example Usage
- User: "How is the weather?"
- Assistant: "Which city?"
- User: "New York"
- Assistant: "The weather in New York is partly cloudy with a temperature of 20Â°C."

## Troubleshooting
1. Ensure your microphone is properly configured.
2. Check your internet connection for API calls.
3. Validate the API keys and replace them if expired.
